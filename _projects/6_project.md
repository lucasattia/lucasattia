This paper was the second in my PhD, and was a really exciting foray into using molecular dynamics simulations to understand material systems. A previous PhD student had observed that when we make drug nanoparticles using the technology my group has developed, the 'crystallinity' (or percentage of the nanoparticle that is crystalline vs. amorphous, see the image below) was extremely difficult to control.

Crystallinity is crucial to drug formulation because it impacts how quickly a drug dissolves, which directly affects its bioavailability—the extent and rate at which the active drug is absorbed and becomes available at the site of action. So this lack of control is quite problematic in terms of applying our technology to formulating a variety of drugs into nanoparticles. Since we were looking at molecular-scale interactions, I turned to molecular dynamics simulations to understand what interactions governed this behavior. In this study, I focused on the tug-of-war between surfactants and polymers on the nanocrystal surface. This competition isn’t just a minor detail; it’s a key player in determining whether the drug remains in a crystalline form or transitions to an amorphous state, which dissolves faster and is often more effective.

The takeaway from my research is that by carefully tuning these surfactant-polymer interactions, we can create drug formulations with controlled crystallinity, leading to more precise and potentially more effective treatments. It’s a small but significant step forward in the world of drug delivery, and I’m excited about the potential applications this could have in developing better medications.
