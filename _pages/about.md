I am PhD candidate in chemical engineering researching at [MIT](https://cheme.mit.edu/). I work on designing novel materials and processes for drug delivery and formulation by combining expertise in soft materials, nanotechnology, and molecular modeling and simulation. I am advised by Professor [Patrick S. Doyle](https://doylegroup.mit.edu/). I am passionate about integrating computational modeling and experiments to create and understand innovative macromolecular and composite materials. I am a strong communicator passionate about fostering collaboration and mentorship in research environments.

I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Delaware in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. There, I worked with Professor [Catherine A. Fromen](https://sites.udel.edu/cfromen/research/) on nanoparticle drug delivery and fluid transport modeling through cellular foams.
