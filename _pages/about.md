I am PhD researcher in chemical engineering researching at [MIT](https://cheme.mit.edu/) in the [Doyle Group](https://doylegroup.mit.edu/). I work on designing novel materials and processes for drug formulation by combining expertise in nanotechnology, molecular simulation, and machine learning. I am passionate about integrating computational modeling and experiments to design and understand better materials. I am an accomplished communicator, with 6 peer-reviewed publications, 25+ presentations at international conferences and symposia, and 12 award-winning presentaitons. I am passionate about fostering collaboration and mentorship in research environments.

I earned my undergraduate degree at the University of Delaware in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry. There, I worked in the [Fromen Research Group](https://sites.udel.edu/cfromen/research/) on nanoparticle drug delivery and fluid transport modeling through cellular foams.
